# Report

As a class, we brainstormed and came up with a long list of further questions we can ask based
on the "self-introduction" data. Out of these questions, our team chose to tackle on
the following:

# Who is not a Computer Science major?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# How many people responded before the first class?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# How many people are Applied Math majors?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}

# How many people said "food" in their favorite foods?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}
